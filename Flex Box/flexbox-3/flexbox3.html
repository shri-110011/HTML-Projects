        <h3>Here we learn the flex item property: flex-grow and flex-shrink</h3>
        <p>Here we use just flex-basis property set as auto.</p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="item1">One</div>
            <div class="item1">Two</div>
        </div>
        <p>Here we use just flex-basis property set as auto and the flex-grow set as 1. 
        So the available remaining space in the flex-container is being divided equally.</p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="item2">One</div>
            <div class="item2">Two</div>
        </div>
        <p>Here we use just flex-basis property set as auto and the flex-grow set as 2
        for first item and 1 for second item. 
        So the available remaining space in the flex-container is being divided 
        proportionally.</p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="item3">One</div>
            <div class="item2">Two</div>
        </div>
        <p>Here we use just flex-basis property set as auto and the flex-shrink set as 1. 
        So the space would be taken away equally from each flex-item.</p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="item4">One</div>
            <div class="item4">Two</div>
            <div class="item4">One</div>
            <div class="item4">Two</div>
        </div>
        <p>Here we use just flex-basis property set as auto and the flex-shrink set as 2
        for the first item and 1 for the second item. 
        So the space would be taken away proportionally from each flex-item.</p>
